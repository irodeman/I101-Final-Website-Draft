        <h3>Brief Bio</h3>
        <p>Jean Bartik was born Betty Jean Jennings in Gentry County, Missouri on December 27th, 1924. 
            She attended Northwest Missouri State Teachers College where she earned a math degree. 
            It was after this when she found mathematics work with the US Army and met her husband William Bartik. 
            They married in 1946 and had 3 children that Jean stepped away from her work to raise in the late 50s and early 60s.
             She later got a master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and continued working in the computing industry with a variety of different companies well into the 80s. 
             After 1986 she pivoted to working as a real estate agent for 25 years then unfortunately passing away in 2011 due to congestive heart failure when she was 86 years old.</p>

        <h3>Under-Representation</h3>
        <p>Despite her and her fellow female colleagues’ massive contribution to the creation of the ENIAC, 
            they were not introduced at its public ceremony and were not even given credit publicly until years later. 
            They were not given access to the actual machine during their work on it and were forced to teach themselves 
            how to program based on only hardware diagrams. The female team on the ENIAC only had their story told after a 
            student at Harvard began researching the women in 1985, 40 years after the project was unveiled to the public. 
            Bartik also faced issues with being a woman in this field later when she was working at the same company as her husband,
             the company then asked her to resign due to a policy they had about spouses working together. 
             She was also pressured after she got her math degree to stay home and be a teacher rather than pursuing a career in computing with the military.</p>

        <h3>Contribution</h3>
        <p>Jean Bartik’s contributions to technology were very important to the US Army, where she did most of her computing work. 
            As one of the original 6 programmers for ENIAC, she and the other women on her team taught themselves how to program the machine. 
            ENIAC and its programmers helped the military calculate ballistic trajectories instead of having human calculators do the equations 
            by hand, which is what Bartik was doing before she was called to program. The ENIAC was faster than the Mark I at Harvard, and completed 
            calculations that would take a human 40 hours in 20 seconds. It was 1,000 times faster than any other machine at the time. In the 40s, 
            Bartik led a team that converted ENIAC into a stored program computer. She also went on to work with the ENIAC designers to develop two 
            other computers, the BINAC and UNIVAC I. All these contributions with ENIAC relate to the computational thinking pillar of informatics, 
            because Bartik used that pillar to develop the computers she worked on and change the way the army handled calculations forever.</p>

        <h3>Selection</h3>
        <p>Some of our other choices that our group did research on included Maria Klawe, Timnit Gebru, 
            Erica Baker and Susan Landau. We chose Jean because we felt that she stood out due to her involvement 
            in the creation of ENIAC which ultimately led us to where we are today with technology, computer science, 
            the use of these things in our everyday lives and also leading to more affordable and more accessible computers 
            for the general population. Although all of the people stood out for different reasons, we felt that her 
            perseverance to push through all of the discouragement that she faced as well as the way she was dismissed for 
            her contribution but continued to work hard in the field and accomplish huge things was really inspiring, especially for her time.</p>

        <h3>Future Promise</h3>
        <p>Jean not only contributed to the creation of the ENIAC, which was completely different from anything before during the 40s, but this also opened up the gateway to technology and computers rapidly developing. Soon after the ENIAC, computers and machines began to become smaller, faster and overall more affordable to get your hands on. Some of these computers and machines include the UNIVAC, BINAC and EDVAC. The ENIAC also paved the way for the individual computer that people use today and played a huge role in the Information Age. Although the ENIAC was decommissioned in 1955, it left a lasting impact on everyone in the technology world and inspired many others to build computers and find new ways to make technology innovative. Although Jean was underrepresented during her time in the field and was often discouraged to follow through with her passions and the things she accomplished, such as being dismissed as a contributor to the ENIAC initially, and even being encouraged to become a math teacher back at home instead of pursuing the field of technology and programming for the military, she is now recognized for her contributions and huge accomplishments. Not only was she an inspiration to people in the technology field in her day and age, but also for young women and girls because of the underrepresentation and inequalities that they
            have faced in the workforce, which was still very apparent at this time. She’s also an inspiration for young women today pursuing a career in the technology field or computer science field due to the fact that women are still the minority in the field among men.</p>
