                <br>
                <p para>We’ve conducted research regarding our chosen innovator, finding information regarding her upbringing, her achomplishments  and contribiutions to society and the world of innvoation. We’ve also been able to note how underrepresentation was apparent during her time, and the adversities she had to overcome because of it. We have now just completed a FIGMA web design, depicting how our future website will look, curating a “Meet the Team Page”, and “Innovator and Contribution” page, demonstarting our research and a snyopsis of our choosen invoator along with extensive information upon our research. We also included an images page to include further images for reference of both our innovator and some of the contributions she was involved in. We’ve met three times times to discuss and overview our project, and check in with each other. We’ve all been communicating and checking in over messages. </p>
